# A linked list is a data structure used to organize data in a sequence, where each element (called a "node") contains two parts:

# Data: The actual value stored in the node.

# Pointer/Reference: A link to the next node in the sequence.

# Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a contiguous block of memory, making them dynamic and more flexible when handling memory.

# Types of Linked Lists
# Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to null.

# Doubly Linked List: Each node has two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node.

# Circular Linked List: The last node links back to the first node, forming a circle.

# How It Works
# Insertion:

# To add a new node, the pointer of the previous node is updated to link to the new node.

# This process can take place at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.

# Traversal:

# Starting from the head node, you follow each pointer to visit all nodes in the list.

# In singly linked lists, you can only traverse forward, while in doubly linked lists, you can traverse in both directions.

# Deletion:

# The node to be deleted is unlinked by updating the pointer of the previous node to skip the unwanted node.

# The memory used by the removed node is freed.

# Searching:

# To find a specific value, you traverse the list and check the data field of each node until the value is located.

# Advantages
# Dynamic Size: A linked list can grow or shrink as needed, unlike arrays.

# Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements in the middle of the list is easier compared to arrays.

# Disadvantages
# Sequential Access: Unlike arrays, you cannot directly access elements by index.

# Extra Memory: Each node requires extra memory for the pointer/reference.

# Example
# Hereâ€™s a simple representation of a singly linked list:

# plaintext
# [Data: 10 | Next: *] -> [Data: 20 | Next: *] -> [Data: 30 | Next: null]
